This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: unexpected nil values during optional unwrapping. The `bug.swift` file contains code that uses a guard statement to handle a nil optional parameter. However, it fails to account for potential errors in the subsequent code which uses this parameter. `bugSolution.swift` offers a more robust solution that handles potential errors in the later processing of the optional parameter.
